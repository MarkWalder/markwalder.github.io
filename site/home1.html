<p class="style">&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's get something clear—the Stumpjumper EVO Comp Alloy 27.5 isn't a "normal" trail bike. It's built to get gnarly, and there's no real way around that. It has a slacked-out front-end and a longer top tube, so the EVO has heavier steering, exceptional front-end traction, and it begs you to boost every lip and do cutties as often as possible. And with the flick-ability that 27.5-inch wheels are known for, you can add-in even more steeze.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly is "EVO" for? EVO is for the shredders—the gnarliest trail riders who live for gravity riding. Big drops, huge kickers, rocks, roots—whatever you throw at it, the Stumpjumper EVO can handle it. EVO uses the same style-specific sizing that's featured on our Demo. This sizing lets you choose the bike that fits the way you ride—not just by the seat tube measurement like with most bikes—and it narrows things down to two sizes, S2 and S3. These are longer, lower, slacker, and have seat tube and head tube heights that allow you to choose the size that best suits your style and terrain.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our other design goal was simple—build the ultimate trail bike, one that feels telepathic. And it turns out that this feeling all comes down to stiffness. Think of it this way: when the frame's telling your hands one thing and your feet another, your brain gets confused with the imbalance and the bike feels unstable. In order to fix this, we had to get to work on dialing-in the materials and shapes.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We continued down the suspension path with a custom Rx Trail Tune on both the fork and rear shock. Suspension performance is highly dependent on frame, wheel, and rider size, so we use our Rx Tune to get each bike to land in the middle of the adjustment spectrum, and this gives you the biggest possible range to fine-tune your ride. Another focal point of the tune was matching the suspension characteristics between wheel sizes—we developed a specific Rx Tune for each platform. So, no matter what wheel size you prefer, you'll get perfectly linear suspension.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Steps were also taken to make this bike easy to live with. Threaded bottom brackets make a triumphant return, and we made room for up to a 2.8" tire. You're also free to run whatever aftermarket rear shock you want, since we're using standard metric shocks. And customization is furthered with a Flip Chip that lets you to dial-in your Stumpy to your riding style. Switch it from High to Low and it drops your bottom bracket 6mm and slackens the head tube by half-a-degree. Little details also jump out to surprise you, like a newly designed ribbed chainstay protector that makes chain slap a thing of the past and nearly silences the drivetrain.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The build here keeps the "EVO" theme going, with ready-to-shred parts like a FOX DPX2 rear shock (150mm of travel), FOX Rhythm 36 fork (150mm of travel), SRAM Code R brakes, and Roval Traverse 27.5 alloy wheels. And when you top it off with SRAM's NX Eagle drivetrain, you'll have no problem getting it to the top of the runs, either.</p>

 <h3 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">Stumpjumper EVO Geometry</h3>
 <p class="style">&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the alloy model, there will be both 27.5in and 29in versions of the Stumpjumper EVO Carbon. Likewise, there will also be two frame sizes in each platform: S2 being the shorter option and S3 being the longer option. Seat tubes are kept short to allow for big stroke dropper posts and the option to upsize if one chooses to do so.
 <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of wheelsize, you’re looking at a head angle that’s been borrowed directly from the current Demo downhill bike. So that’d be 63.5° then.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s paired to a reduced offset fork to maximise the trail measurement. The 29er Stumpy EVO has a 44mm fork offset to deliver a huge 134-138mm of trail, while the 27.5in bike features a 37mm fork offset for 133-137mm of trail.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep weight over the front end, and for added pep on the climbs, Specialized has chosen a 76° seat angle. You do have the choice of High/Low geometry settings though, with a flip-chip inside the lower shock mount allowing you to tweak the angles and BB height.

 <h3 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">Stumpjumper EVO Suspension</h3>
 <p class="style">&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspension travel is the same as the EVO Alloy platform, so you’ve got 150/150mm for the 27.5in platform, and 150/140mm for the 29in platform.
 <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suspension at both ends comes from Fox Racing Shox, since Specialized seems to have gone a bit quiet on the Öhlins front.	
 <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That’s fine with us, because up front is a popular 36 Float fork with the superb GRIP2 damper, which is matched to a DHX2 coil shock out back. The ‘RX Trail Tuned’ shock uses standard Metric spacing, measuring 210mm eye-to-eye, with either a 50mm stroke (29er) or a 52.5mm stroke (27.5in).
 <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you’re on the S2 size, you get a 500lb coil spring as standard. S3 frames will come with a heavier 550lb spring.</p>

<h3 style="position: relative;text-align: center;">The Build Kit</h3>
<p class="style">&nbsp;&nbsp;As of right now, there’s only one Stumpjumper EVO Carbon model coming into both the UK and Australia; the Pro. The spec is quite a bit higher than the Alloy Comp, and the price reflects that.

 <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Highlights include hugely powerful SRAM Code RSC brakes with 200mm rotors, Roval Traverse Carbon wheels that feature a 30mm internal rim width, and 2.6in wide Specialized Butcher tyres. Curiously for such a hooligan-worthy bike, the tyres only get the lightweight GRID casing, and not the newer and more robust BLK DMND casing.</p>

<p class="style">&nbsp;&nbsp;Specialized rounds out the cockpit with 800mm wide riser bars, and its own 160mm travel dropper post that makes full use of the fat 34.9mm diameter seat tube. Nice touches include the side-entry bottle cage, and a SWAT Conceal Carry MTB tool inside the fork steerer tube.</p>
